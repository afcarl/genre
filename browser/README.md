=======

A page-level browser that allows a user to page through text files (delimited with <pb> for pagebreaks) recording genre codes for each page. The initial version was written by Michael L. Black; the GUI was perfected by Boris Capitanu.

It requires a list of allowable genre codes (ours is provided here as codes.ini.) It saves the page-level tags produced in ARFF format (compatible with Weka).

The .jar file here contains the browser in an executable form.

**/backend** and **/gui** are folders holding the source code. But if you really want to mess with the source code, you're probably better off getting it from [the repo where it was actually developed.](https://github.com/tedunderwood/pagetagger)
