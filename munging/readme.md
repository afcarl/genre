munging
=======

Various Python utilities that munged data or evaluated results.

**SelectFeatures.py** was used, logically enough, for feature selection.

**Evaluate.py** evaluates the accuracy of page-level models produced by the Java code in the /pages folder. The modules it imports include, in this folder, **ConfusionMatrix,** **MetadataCascades,** and **SonicScrewdriver.**

**HumanDissensus.py** measured the degree of dissensus between five human readers.
